# CPC357-Smart-Air
IoT-Driven Smart Air Conditioning System optimizes energy usage in urban environments using sensors like PIR for motion detection, DHT for temperature and humidity, and MQ2 for gas monitoring. It adjusts AC settings based on real-time data, simulates cooling via a fan motor, and sends alerts for gas hazards, promoting sustainability and safety.
